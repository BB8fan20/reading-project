<h1>
My project for the <u>mark of Athena</u> represents perserverance.  In the the tunnel it represents Annabeth long struggling life. For example with the relationship struggle between her and her mom athena.  Doing the story she gets hit hard with a really hard
obstacle of awakening of the earth god gaea,and her need to take over all of the world and to distroy humanity. Also with the two 
giants who are the source of gaea awakening from her sleep and taking over. The only way that annabeth can save the earth is to distroy the two giants so gaea won't awaken.</h1>
